An artwork-trading marketplace where an artist can create and sell their artworks as NFTs, where buyers can turn their owned NFTs into resellable assets, with artists getting royalty percentages. And an approval mechanism to facilitate Broker aspect of an art exhibition.

The marketplace uses the underlying blockchain network of [spartanGold](https://github.com/taustin/spartan-gold) and is an extension of it.

**Futurework*: Does not support storage and transfer mechanism for artwork across blockchain. Also the royalty settting is quite basic and can be improved to make the percentages variable over number of resales.
